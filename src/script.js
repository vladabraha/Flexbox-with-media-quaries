/* CHALLENGE: 

a. Place all 5 figures are on the same row with a 2% gap between each box. You should not need to change the HTML to do this. 

b. If the window is less than 850px, have 3 boxes on one row and 2 boxes on the second row. Maintain the 2% gap between each box in the first row. (You'll have >2% gap on the 2nd row.) Distribute any gap as evenly as you can if it's greater than 2%.

c. BONUS: 
At smaller screen dimensions (<= 850px), have the boxes appear in the center of the page.

 At >850px, align the single row of boxes at the bottom of the page using Flexbox-specific properties (i.e. not margin or positioning).
